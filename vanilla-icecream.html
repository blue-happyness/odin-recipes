    <h1 style="color:purple;"><u>Vanilla Ice Cream Recipe</u></h1>
    <p>This homemade ice cream is easy to make with just 4 ingredients: pure vanilla extract, milk, heavy whipping cream, and sugar. This American-style ice cream makes for a brighter, more pronounced vanilla flavor.</p>
    
    <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
    <ul>
    <li>1.25 cups of milk</li> 
    <li>1 Cup of heavy whipping cream</li> 
    <li>0.75 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

<h3><u>Instructions</u></h3>
<ol>
<li>Stir milk, cream, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until the mixture is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge.</li>
<li>Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)</li>
<li>Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
<li>When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in the freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
</ol>
